# php-class-Err

Error handling class for PHP. Handles all errors generated by PHP, enables logging for production environments and instant feedback for development.

##Basic set up

Create a directory for the log files and add two empty files called background.txt and terminal.txt.

Initialise Err as early as possible and tell it where the log directory is.

```php
<?php

include '/path/to/Err.php';

Err::initialise([
  'log_directory' => '/path/to/log/dir'
]);

```

If errors are recorded and need to be logged, the details are encoded as a JSON string and stored on an individual line in the relevant log file.

##Error types

The class categorises errors as three types: *ignore*, *background* and *terminal*. It is set up with default values which can be overwritten if needed. Only *ignore* and *background* values are set, anything else is considered *terminal*.

If only *ignore* errors occur during run time, nothing is logged and the script runs as intended.

If any *background* errors occur (regardless of *ignore* errors or not), then *all* errors will be logged in the defined background file and the script runs as intended.

If any errors occur that are not listed in *ignore* or *background* then the script will terminate. Errors will be dumped to screen or logged in the defined terminal file - see [Terminal message](#terminal-message).

Allowed values for *ignore* and *background* are `E_WARNING`, `E_NOTICE`, `E_CORE_WARNING`, `E_COMPILE_WARNING`, `E_USER_WARNING`, `E_USER_NOTICE`, `E_STRICT`, `E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR`, `E_DEPRECATED` and `E_USER_DEPRECATED`. Any other constants submitted will result in an Exception being thrown.

Here is an example of initialisation including defining error types (this example sets the defult values).

```php
<?php

include '/path/to/Err.php';

Err::initialise([
  'log_directory' => '/path/to/log/dir',
  'errors_background' => E_WARNING | E_CORE_WARNING | E_COMPILE_WARNING | E_USER_WARNING | E_DEPRECATED | E_USER_DEPRECATED,
  'errors_ignore' => E_NOTICE | E_USER_NOTICE | E_STRICT
]);

```

If an error code is set for *ignore* and *background*, the error code will be categorised as *ignore*.

##Terminal message

By default, if the class encounters a *terminal* error it will dump the entire error log to screen. A string can be echo'd instead and the error will be logged to the defined terminal file. 

Here is how to set the terminal message during initialisation.

```php
<?php

include '/path/to/Err.php';

Err::initialise([
  'log_directory' => '/path/to/log/dir',
  'terminal_message' => '<h1>Sorry</h1><hr><p>Something went wrong. We have logged the error.</p>'
]);

```

##All valid options during initialisation

The following example shows initialisation with all valid options being set with their default values. The only required option is `log_directory`. The class will function with all other default values.


```php
<?php

Err::initialise([
	'errors_background'   => E_WARNING | E_CORE_WARNING | E_COMPILE_WARNING | E_USER_WARNING | E_DEPRECATED | E_USER_DEPRECATED,
	'errors_ignore'       => E_NOTICE | E_USER_NOTICE | E_STRICT,
	'log_directory'       => '',
	'log_file_background' => 'background.txt',
	'log_file_terminal'   => 'terminal.txt',
	'terminal_message'    => false,
	'timestamp'           => time()
]);
```

##Logging extra data

It is possible to add extra data to the error logs for help with debugging. Adding log data should be done after initialisation. Here's an example,

```php
<?php

Err::addLogData([
  'organisation_id' => $_SESSION['organisation_id'],
  'user_id'         => $_SESSION['user_id']
]);
```

The Organisation ID and User ID will now be stored in the log.
